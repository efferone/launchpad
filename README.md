The landing page / launchpad for accessing, monitoring and configuring my various servers and services. Built with HTML and PHP.

## Updated, instead of NGINX I am now using OpenResty, no need for the php files, now using Lua scripts.
## Better performance (well, quicker calls than my PHP scripts, plus added caching)
## my old dashboard (LXC container) is still on my host, but powered down while I run more tests on this one.
