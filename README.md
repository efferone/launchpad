# The landing page / launchpad for accessing, monitoring and configuring my various servers and services. Built with HTML and PHP.

## Updated, instead of NGINX I am now using OpenResty, no need for the php files, now using Lua scripts.

## Better performance (well, quicker calls than my PHP scripts, plus added caching)

## I don't know Lua, so a bit and back and forward with genAI, and more back and forward and more..
## stripped the scripts down to be pretty minimal for now with what I do understand of Lua, and my system stats
## are working
